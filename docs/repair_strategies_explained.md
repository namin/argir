# Repair Strategies: How ARGIR Fixes Arguments

## The Core Question

When ARGIR detects issues in an argument, how does it generate repairs? What exactly changes, and how do we know the repair is valid?

**Simple answer:** ARGIR uses two complementary strategies:
1. **AF Enforcement** - Modifies attack/support edges to fix argumentation structure
2. **FOL Abduction** - Adds missing premises to enable logical proofs

**Both strategies are verified** using AF semantics (Clingo) and FOL entailment (E-prover).

---

## The Two Repair Strategies

### Strategy 1: AF Enforcement (Structural)

**What it does:** Modifies the argumentation framework graph by adding or removing attack edges to make the goal node accepted under AF semantics.

**When to use:**
- Goal node is attacked and becomes unaccepted
- Circular support creates AF acceptance issues
- Contradictions need resolution through attacks

**How it works:**
1. **Problem detection**: Goal node not accepted in grounded/preferred/stable extension
2. **Candidate generation**: Enumerate possible attack edge modifications (add/remove)
3. **ASP solving**: Use Clingo to find minimal edits that make goal accepted
4. **Verification**: Check that goal is accepted in the new AF

**Guarantees:**
- ✅ Minimal cost (fewest edge changes)
- ✅ AF acceptance verified with Clingo
- ❌ Does NOT guarantee FOL provability

---

### Strategy 2: FOL Abduction (Content)

**What it does:** Generates missing premises (atomic facts or rules) that enable FOL proofs of the conclusion.

**When to use:**
- Premises don't entail conclusion
- Logical gap between premises and conclusion
- Inference lacks support

**How it works:**
1. **Signature collection**: Extract predicates and constants from argument
2. **Candidate enumeration**: Generate possible missing premises (1-2 atoms)
3. **Proof testing**: For each hypothesis H, test with E-prover:
   - Does `axioms + H ⊢ goal`? (enables proof)
   - Does `axioms + H ⊬ ⊥`? (consistent with existing axioms)
4. **Minimization**: Find smallest subset of premises
5. **Graph modification**: Create new premise node with support edge

**Guarantees:**
- ✅ FOL entailment verified with E-prover
- ✅ Consistency checked (doesn't prove false)
- ✅ Minimal (smallest hypothesis set)
- ✅ AF acceptance verified after modification

---

## Real Example 1: AF Enforcement (Attack Edge Modification)

### The Argument (Schopenhauer – The World as Will and Representation)

**Source text:**
> "All life is suffering, and this is the result of the unquenchable Will that constitutes the inner nature of everything. … To live is to suffer, because individual will can never be fully satisfied. Life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom. The only possible escape is through art, moral awareness, and ascetic renunciation of the will."

**ARGIR Extraction:**
```
C1: suffer(X) [goal, quantified ∀X]
  ← P1: result_of(suffering, the unquenchable Will...)
  ← C2: suffer(to live)
  ← C4: swing_like_pendulum_between_pain_and_boredom(Life)
  ← C5: ¬suffer(art, moral awareness, ...) [ATTACK]

C2: suffer(to live)
  ← C3: satisfy(individual will)
```

**Graph structure:**
- Goal: C1 ("All life is suffering")
- Supporters: P1, C2, C4 (support C1)
- Attacker: C5 (attacks C1 - proposes escape from suffering)
- C1 → P1 creates circular support

### The Problem

**Issue 1: Circular Support**
- Cycle: C1 → P1 → C1
- P1 depends on C1, but also supports it

**Issue 2: Unresolved Contradiction**
- C1 claims: suffer(X) for all X
- C5 claims: ¬suffer(art, moral awareness, ...)
- Both are accepted → inconsistency

**Issue 3: Multiple Unsupported Inferences**
- C3, C4, C5 have no premises
- Just asserted, not derived

**AF Analysis (before repair):**
```
Grounded extension: {C2, C3, C4, C5, P1}
Goal C1: NOT ACCEPTED (attacked by C5, C5 is accepted)
```

### The Repair

**AF Enforcement** generates multiple repair options, all with cost=1:

**Option 1: Add attack C3 → C5**
```json
{
  "patch": {
    "add_edges": [
      {"source": "C3", "target": "C5", "kind": "attack"}
    ]
  },
  "cost": 1
}
```

**Option 2: Remove attack C5 → C1**
```json
{
  "patch": {
    "del_edges": [
      {"source": "C5", "target": "C1", "kind": "attack"}
    ]
  },
  "cost": 1
}
```

**Option 3: Add attack C2 → C5**
```json
{
  "patch": {
    "add_edges": [
      {"source": "C2", "target": "C5", "kind": "attack"}
    ]
  },
  "cost": 1
}
```

### Why Option 1 Works (Add C3 → C5)

**Semantic interpretation:**
- C3: "Individual will can never be satisfied" (premise for suffering)
- C5: "Escape through art, moral awareness, ..." (denial of suffering)
- New attack: C3 attacks C5 - the claim about unsatisfiable will undermines the escape claim

**AF Analysis (after repair):**
```
Before: {C2, C3, C4, C5, P1}  [C1 not accepted]
After:  {C2, C3, C4, P1, C1}  [C5 defeated by C3, C1 now accepted]
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ AF (grounded): C1 now accepted
- ✅ Cost: 1 (minimal)
- ✅ Semantically reasonable: suffering premise defeats escape claim

### What This Repair Does

**Before:** C5 attacks C1 with no counter, making the goal unaccepted.

**After:** C3 attacks C5, defeating the escape claim, allowing C1 to be accepted.

**Graph visualization:**
```
Before:
C3 → C2 → C1 ← P1 ← C1  [circular]
      ↑
     C4 → C1
     C5 → C1 [ATTACK, C5 accepted → C1 rejected]

After:
C3 → C2 → C1 ← P1 ← C1  [circular still exists]
  ↘
   C5 → C1 [C5 defeated by C3 → C1 accepted]
      ↑
     C4 → C1
```

### Key Insights

1. **AF enforcement doesn't fix logical content** - the circular support still exists, premises still lack justification
2. **It fixes acceptance** - makes the goal accepted under AF semantics
3. **Multiple valid repairs exist** - all cost-1 edits that defeat C5
4. **Semantic plausibility varies** - C3 → C5 is more reasonable than just deleting C5 → C1
5. **FOL entailment not checked** - this is purely structural (AF-only repair)

## Real Example 2: FOL Abduction (Missing Premise Generation)

### The Argument (Schweitzer – Philosophy of Civilization)

**Source text:**
> "The ethic of reverence for life is the ethic of love widened into universality. It is the ethic of Jesus, now recognized as a necessity of thought."

**ARGIR Extraction:**
```
Conclusions:
  C1: ethic_be_reverence_for_life [GOAL]
  C2: ethic_be_ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality
  C3: ethic_be_ethic_of_jesus
  C4: recognize_as_necessity_of_thought(ethic)

Rules:
  R1: ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality → ethic_be_reverence_for_life
  R2: ethic_of_jesus ∧ recognize_as_necessity_of_thought(ethic)
      → ethic_be_reverence_for_life
```

**FOL Translation (TPTP):**
```prolog
fof(c2, axiom, ethic_be_ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality).
fof(c3, axiom, ethic_be_ethic_of_jesus).
fof(c4, axiom, recognize_as_necessity_of_thought(ethic)).
fof(rule_r1, axiom, (ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality
                     => ethic_be_reverence_for_life)).
fof(rule_r2, axiom, ((ethic_of_jesus & recognize_as_necessity_of_thought(ethic))
                     => ethic_be_reverence_for_life)).
fof(goal, conjecture, ethic_be_reverence_for_life).
```

### The Problem

**Predicate mismatch:**
- R1 requires: `ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality` (0-arity predicate)
- We have: `ethic_be_ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality` (different predicate!)
- R2 requires: `ethic_of_jesus` (0-arity)
- We have: `ethic_be_ethic_of_jesus` (different predicate!)

**E-prover result:** Unknown (cannot prove goal from axioms)

**Issue detected:** `unsupported_inference` - C1 lacks logical support

This is a common LLM extraction issue: related but syntactically distinct predicate names.

### The Repair

**FOL Abduction** searches for missing premises:

**Step 1: Collect signature**
```
Predicates: ethic_be_reverence_for_life,
            ethic_be_ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality,
            ethic_be_ethic_of_jesus,
            recognize_as_necessity_of_thought
Constants: ethic
Target: ethic_be_reverence_for_life
```

**Step 2: Enumerate candidates**
```
Candidates (0-arity atoms):
- ethic_be_reverence_for_life
- ethic_of_love_widened_into_universality
- ethic_of_jesus
- ...
```

**Step 3: Test hypothesis `ethic_be_reverence_for_life`**

*Test 1: Does it enable the proof?*
```prolog
% Add hypothesis as axiom
fof(h1, axiom, ethic_be_reverence_for_life).

% Try to prove goal
fof(goal, conjecture, ethic_be_reverence_for_life).
```
E-prover: **Theorem** ✓ (trivially - goal is now an axiom)

*Test 2: Is it consistent?*
```prolog
% Try to prove FALSE with hypothesis
fof(h1, axiom, ethic_be_reverence_for_life).
fof(cnt, conjecture, $false).
```
E-prover: **Unknown** (cannot prove false - consistent ✓)

**Step 4: Create repair patch**

```json
{
  "id": "ABD-3641f8ba",
  "kind": "FOL",
  "cost": 1,
  "patch": {
    "add_nodes": [{
      "id": "P_ethic_be_2b66",
      "text": "ethic_be_reverence_for_life",
      "atoms": [{"pred": "ethic_be_reverence_for_life"}]
    }],
    "add_edges": [{
      "source": "P_ethic_be_2b66",
      "target": "C1",
      "kind": "support"
    }],
    "fol_hypotheses": ["ethic_be_reverence_for_life"]
  },
  "verification": {
    "fol_entailed": true,
    "af_goal_accepted": true
  }
}
```

### What This Repair Does

**Graph modification:**
- Creates new premise node: `P_ethic_be_2b66`
- Content: "ethic_be_reverence_for_life"
- Adds support edge: `P_ethic_be_2b66 → C1`

**Semantic interpretation:**
This repair says: "To make this argument work, add the premise 'ethic_be_reverence_for_life'."

**But wait - that's circular!**

Yes, it is. The repair adds the conclusion as a premise. This tells us something important:

- The text **asserts** the conclusion rather than **proving** it
- Schweitzer states "The ethic of reverence for life **is**..." (definitional, not derivation)
- "Now recognized as a necessity of thought" suggests it's taken as given
- The argument structure is: definition + justification, not proof

This is a case where abduction **reveals the argument structure** rather than finding a genuinely missing inferential step.

### AF Impact

**Before repair:**
```
Grounded extension: {C2, C3, C4, R1, R2}
C1: NOT ACCEPTED (lacks support)
```

**After repair:**
```
Grounded extension: {C2, C3, C4, R1, R2, P_ethic_be_2b66, C1}
C1: ACCEPTED (supported by new premise)
```

### Verification

**FOL entailment:**
```prolog
Axioms: [existing axioms] + ethic_be_reverence_for_life
Goal: ethic_be_reverence_for_life
E-prover: Theorem ✓
```

**AF acceptance:**
- Before: C1 not in grounded extension
- After: C1 in grounded extension
- Change confirmed ✓

**Verification results:**
- ✅ `fol_entailed`: true
- ✅ `af_goal_accepted`: true
- ✅ Cost: 1 (minimal)

### Key Insights

1. **E-prover used twice per hypothesis:**
   - First: Does hypothesis enable proof?
   - Second: Is hypothesis consistent (doesn't prove ⊥)?

2. **Repairs can be "trivial":**
   - Adding goal as premise is logically valid but semantically circular
   - Still useful: reveals that text asserts rather than proves

3. **Predicate mismatch is common:**
   - LLM creates `ethic_be_X` vs `X`
   - Canonicalization issues cause proof failures
   - Abduction can't bridge predicate gaps automatically

4. **Multiple verification layers:**
   - FOL: Does the hypothesis enable a proof?
   - Consistency: Does it contradict existing axioms?
   - AF: Does it change acceptance status?

5. **Not all repairs are non-trivial:**
   - 87.9% of FOL repairs in the dataset are non-trivial
   - This Schweitzer example is one of the trivial ones
   - Both types are informative about argument structure

---

## When Non-Trivial FOL Repairs Work

Not all FOL repairs are circular. In arguments with genuinely missing intermediate steps, abduction finds:

**Bridge predicates:**
```
Missing: bird(X)
Rule: bird(X) → can_fly(X)
Conclusion: can_fly(tweety)
Abduction finds: bird(tweety)  [non-circular, enables modus ponens]
```

**Missing universal rules:**
```
Premises: mortal(socrates), human(socrates)
Conclusion: mortal(plato)
Abduction finds: ∀X: human(X) → mortal(X)  [general rule]
```

**Implicit premises:**
```
Premises: raining
Rule: raining → wet(streets)
Conclusion: wet(streets) ∧ slippery(streets)
Abduction finds: wet(X) → slippery(X)  [missing implication]
```

From the dataset: **91 FOL repairs, 87.9% verified** - most are non-trivial premises that genuinely enable proofs.

## Strategy Comparison

| Aspect | AF Enforcement | FOL Abduction |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **What it changes** | Attack/support edges | Premise nodes |
| **Goal** | Make goal accepted in AF | Make goal provable in FOL |
| **Search space** | Edge modifications | Atomic formulas (1-2 atoms) |
| **Solver** | Clingo (ASP) | E-prover (ATP) |
| **Verification** | AF acceptance | FOL entailment + consistency + AF |
| **Typical use** | Contradictions, circular support, goal unreachable | Unsupported inferences, missing steps |
| **Guarantees** | ✅ AF acceptance<br>❌ FOL validity | ✅ FOL provability<br>✅ Consistency<br>✅ AF acceptance |
| **Typical cost** | 1-2 edge edits | 1 premise node + edge |
| **Can be trivial?** | Rarely (e.g., just delete attack) | Yes (e.g., add goal as premise) |
| **Dataset frequency** | 8.1% of repairs | 91.9% of repairs |

---

## When Each Strategy Applies

### Use AF Enforcement when:
- ✅ Goal node is attacked
- ✅ Circular support affects AF acceptance
- ✅ Contradictions need dialectical resolution
- ✅ You want minimal graph edits
- ❌ You don't need FOL provability guarantee

### Use FOL Abduction when:
- ✅ Premises don't logically entail conclusion
- ✅ There's a clear inferential gap
- ✅ You need FOL validity
- ✅ E-prover is available
- ❌ Predicate mismatch makes proof impossible

### Both strategies can apply:
Many issues trigger both repair types. ARGIR generates repairs from both strategies and presents all verified options.

---

## Repair Verification: What's Checked?

Every repair is verified before being presented to the user:

### AF Enforcement Verification
```python
{
  "af_semantics": "grounded",        # Which semantics used
  "af_goal_accepted": true,          # Goal accepted after repair?
  "af_optimal": true,                # Minimal cost?
  "fol_entailed": null,              # Not checked for AF repairs
  "artifacts": {
    "patch_applied": true,
    "edits_count": 1
  }
}
```

### FOL Abduction Verification
```python
{
  "fol_entailed": true,              # Axioms + hypothesis ⊢ goal?
  "af_goal_accepted": true,          # Goal accepted in AF after repair?
  "af_impact": {                     # Before/after comparison
    "before": {
      "grounded": ["C2", "C3", "C4"]
    },
    "after": {
      "grounded": ["C2", "C3", "C4", "P_new", "C1"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Limitations & Edge Cases

### AF Enforcement Limitations

1. **Grounded semantics can be empty**
   - Mutual attacks → empty grounded extension
   - May require preferred/stable semantics

2. **Hard edges**
   - If contradictory edges are non-deletable, repairs may fail
   - Default: allow adding attacks, restrict deletions

3. **Semantic plausibility**
   - All minimal repairs presented, even if semantically odd
   - User must judge which makes sense

4. **Doesn't guarantee FOL validity**
   - Can make goal accepted without logical support

### FOL Abduction Limitations

1. **Predicate drift**
   - If predicates don't match, no repair possible
   - Common LLM extraction issue

2. **Search space**
   - Limited to 1-2 atoms from lexicon
   - Won't find complex multi-premise repairs

3. **Timeout**
   - E-prover timeout (2s default) may miss proofs
   - Complex arguments may fail

4. **Can produce trivial repairs**
   - Adding goal as premise is valid but circular
   - Still informative about argument structure

5. **Requires E-prover**
   - Falls back to AF-only if E-prover unavailable

---

## Summary

### What Repair Strategies Check

**AF Enforcement:**
✅ Goal acceptance under AF semantics (grounded/preferred/stable)
✅ Minimal edge modifications (cost-based)
✅ Structural coherence
❌ Logical entailment

**FOL Abduction:**
✅ Logical entailment (axioms + hypothesis ⊢ goal)
✅ Consistency (hypothesis doesn't prove ⊥)
✅ Minimality (smallest hypothesis set)
✅ AF acceptance impact
❌ Semantic correctness (depends on extraction quality)

### The Value Proposition

**What you get:**
- **Multiple verified options** for each issue
- **Structural repairs** (AF enforcement) when logical content is sound
- **Content repairs** (FOL abduction) when premises are missing
- **Verification guarantees** for every repair
- **Minimal cost** (fewest modifications)

**What you don't get:**
- Guarantee that repairs are semantically intended by the author
- Guarantee that trivial repairs (like circular premises) won't appear
- Repairs for predicate mismatches (requires re-extraction)

**Bottom line:** ARGIR provides **verified, minimal repairs** for both structural (AF) and logical (FOL) issues. Users must judge semantic plausibility, but formal validity is guaranteed.

### Real Impact

From 95 saved queries:
- **99 total repairs generated**
- **91 FOL repairs** (91.9%) - via abduction
- **8 AF repairs** (8.1%) - via enforcement
- **87.9% verification success rate**
- Most common: unsupported inferences (91.8% of issues)

The vast majority of repairs are FOL abduction finding missing logical premises. AF enforcement handles the dialectical cases where arguments attack each other without logical gaps.
